    Two Types of Tree Traversal
        (1). Breadth first Search(BFS).

        (2). Depth first Search(DFS).

                    3 way for depth first Search:
                    
                        Inorder : (Traversal from the left of the tree, Root of the tree and Rigth of the tree).
                        PreOrder : (Traversal from the Root of the tree, left of the tree and Right of the tree).
                        PostOrder : (Traversal from the Left of the tree, Right of the tree and Root of the tree).
