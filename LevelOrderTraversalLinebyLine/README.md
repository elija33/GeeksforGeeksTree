Description

In Level Order Traversal Line by Line, we print the nodes at each level separately in a new line.
In this video we discuss:
A function that takes root as a parameter, doesnâ€™t return anything and prints the level order traversal line by line by using method-1.
In method-1, we implement this function using a single loop.
