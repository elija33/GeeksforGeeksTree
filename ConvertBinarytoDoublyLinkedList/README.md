# GeeksforGeeksTree

Inorder conversion of Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List.
A function that takes root of a Binary Tree and converts it into a Doubly linked list.
Hint:- we need to do the inorder traversal of the Tree and while doing inorder traversal we can simply maintain a previous pointer or reference of the previously traversed node. And change right child of the previous node to current node and left child of current node as previous.
